        "text": "Well thank you, are you a teacher? Yes, I think that that's a very good question because I've heard from lots of teachers and parents about some of their concerns, about some of the things that are being said and done in this campaign. And I think it is very important for us to make clear to our children that our country really is great because we are good. And we are going to respect one another, lift each other up. We are going to be looking for ways to celebrate our diversity. And we are going to try to reach out to every boy and girl as well as every adult to bring them in to working on behalf of our country. I have a very positive and optimistic view about what we can do together. That's why the slogan of my campaign is stronger together. Because I think if we work together, if we overcome the divisiveness that sometimes sets Americans against one another, and instead we make some big goals and I've set forth some big goals - getting the economy to work for everyone, not just those at the top, making sure that we have the best education system from preschool through college and making it affordable and so much else, if we set those goals and we go together to try to achieve them there's nothing, in my opinion, that America can't do. So that's why I hope that we will come together in this campaign. Obviously, I'm hoping to earn your vote, I'm hoping to be elected in November, and I can promise you I will work with every American. I want to be the president for all Americans. Regardless of your political beliefs, where you come  from, what you look like, your religion -- I want us to heal our country and bring it together. Because that's, I think, the best way for us to get the future that are children and our grandchildren deserve.",

This is a great country. This is a great land. I've gotten to know the people of the country over the last year and a half that I've been doing this as a politician. I cannot believe that I'm saying that about myself, but I guess I have been a politician. And my whole concept was to make America great again. When I watch the deals being made, when I watch what's happening with some horrible things like Obamacare where your health insurance and health care is going up by numbers that are astronomical 68 percent, 59 percent, 71 percent, when I look at the Iran deal and how bad a deal it is for us, it's a one-sided transaction where we’re giving back one hundred fifty billion dollars to a terrorist state, really, the number one terrorist state, we've made them a strong country from really a very weak country just three years ago. When I look at all of the things that I see and all the potential that our country has, we have such tremendous potential, whether it's in business and trade where we’re doing so badly. Last year we had an almost 800 billion dollar trade deficit.  In other words, trading with other countries we had 800 billion dollars deficit, that’s hard to believe. Inconceivable. You say who's making these deals? We’re going to make great trade deals, we’re going to have a strong border, we’re going to bring back law and order. Just today policemen were shot - two killed - and this is happening on a weekly basis. We have to bring back respect to law enforcement. At the same time we have to take care of people on all sides. We need justice. But I want to do things that haven’t been done including fixing and making our interest that is better for the African-American citizens that are so great and for the Latinos, Hispanics, and I look forward to doing it - it’s called make America great again.",

You know, with prior Republican nominees for president, I disagreed with them -- on politics, policies, and principles, but I never questioned their fitness to serve. Donald Trump is different. I said starting back in June, that he was not fit to be president and commander-in-chief. And many Republicans and independents have said the same thing. What we all saw and heard on Friday was Donald talking about women. What he thinks about women, what he does to women, and he has said that the video doesn't represent who he is. But I think it's clear to anyone who heard it that it represents exactly who he is. Because we've seen this throughout the campaign. We have seen him insult women. We've seen him rate women on their appearance, ranking themfrom one to ten. We've seen him embarrass woman on TV and on Twitter. We saw him after the first debate spend nearly a week denigrating a former Miss Universe in the harshest, most personal terms.So, yes, this is who Donald Trump is. But it's not only women and it’s not only this video that raises questions about his fitness to be our president. Because he has also targeted immigrants, African Americans, Latinos, people with disabilities, POWs, Muslims, and so many others. So this is who Donald Trump is and the question for us, the question our country must answer, is that this is not who we are. That's why, to go back to your question, I want to send a message -- we all should -- to every boy and girl and indeed to the entire world, that America already is great, but we are great because we are good. And we will respect one another and we will work with one another and we will celebrate our diversity. These are very important values to me because this is the America that I know and love. And I can pledge to you tonight that this is the America that I will serve if I'm so fortunate enough to become your president.",

His was far worse -- what he’s done to women, there’s never been anyone in the history of politics in this nation who has been so abusive to women. So you could say anyway you want to say it, but Bill Clinton was abusive to women. Hillary Clinton attacked those same women and attacked them viciously. Four of them here tonight. One of the women, who was a wonderful woman, 12 years old, was raped -- at twelve. Her client -- she represented, got him off. And she’s seen laughing on two separate occasions, laughing at the girl who was raped. Kathy Shelton, that young woman is here with us tonight.So don't tell me about words. I am absolutely - I apologize for those words. But it is things that people say. But what President Clinton did -- he was impeached. He lost his license to practice law. He had to pay an $850,000 fine to one of the women, Paula Jones, who is also here tonight.And I will tell you that when Hillary brings up a point like that and she talks about words that I said eleven years ago, I think it's disgraceful.

And he's the one that got this started along with your campaign manager and they were on television just two weeks ago he was saying exactly that.The you really owe him. Or the one who sent the picture to run your campaign -- the pictures around President Obama in a certain garb. That was long before I was ever involved, so you actually owe an apology. Number two, Michelle Obama -- I've gotten to see the commercials that they did on you. And I’ve gotten to see some of the most vicious commercials I’ve ever seen of Michelle Obama talking about you, Hillary. So you talk about friend, go back and take a look at those commercials. A race where you lost fair and square, unlike the Bernie Sanders race where you won, but not fair and square, in my opinion. And all you have to do is take a look at WikiLeaks and just see what they said about Bernie Sanders and see what Debra Wasserman Schultz had in mind because Bernie Sanders, between superdelegates and Debra Wasserman Schultz, he never had a chance. I was so surprised to see him sign on with the devil. But when you talk about apology,I think the one that you should really be apologizing for -- and the thing that you should be apologizing for are the thirty three thousand e-mails that you deleted and that you acid washed and then the two boxes of e-mails and other things last week that were takenfrom an office and are now missing. And I'll tell you what, I didn’t think I'd say this, but I’m going to say it, and I hate to say it. But if I win, I am going to instruct my Attorney General to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation because there has never been so many lies, so much deception. There has never been anything like it. And we're going to have a special prosecutor.When I speak, I go out and speak, the people of this country are furious. In my opinion, the people that have been long-term workers at the FBI are furious. There has never been anything like this where e-mails and you get a subpoena -- you get a subpoena and after getting the subpoena, you delete 33,000 e-mails. And then you acid wash them or bleach them, as you would say-- a very expensive process. So we're going to get a special prosecutor, and we’re going to look into it. Because you know what? People have been -- their lives have been destroyed for doing one fifth of what you’ve done. And it’s a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.",

Anyone who says otherwise has no basis that any classified material ended up in the wrong hands.I take classified materials very seriously and always have. When I was on the Senate armed service committee, I was privy to lots of classified material.

Premiums have gotten too high, co-pays, deductibles, prescription drug costs. And I have laid out a series of actions that we can take to try and get those costs down. But here’s what I don't want people to forget when we’re talking about reigning in the costs, which has to be the highest priority of the next president. When the Affordable Care Act passed, it wasn't just that twenty million people got insurance that did not have it before. But that in and of itself was a good thing. I meet these people all the time and they tell me what a difference having the insurance meant to them and their families. But everybody else, the one hundred and seventy million of us, who get health insurance through our employers, got big benefits. Number one, insurance companies can’t deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. Number two, no lifetime limits, which is a big deal if you have serious health problems. Number three, women cannot be charged more than men for our health insurance, which is the way it used to be before the Affordable Care Act. Number four, if you are under 26 and your parents have a policy, you can be on that policy until the age of 26.Something that didn’t happen before. So I want to very much to save what works and what is good about the Affordable Care act. But we have got to get costs down, we have to provide some additional help to small businesses so that they can afford to provide health insurance. But if we repeal it, as Donald has proposed, and start over again. All of those benefits I just mentioned are lost to everybody. Not just people who get their health insurance on the exchange, and then we would have to start all over again. Right now, we are at ninety percent health insurance coverage. That is the highest we have ever been in our country.",

It is going up at numbers that nobody has ever seen worldwide. Nobody has ever seen numbers like this for health care. It is only getting worse. In seventeen, it implodes by itself.Their method of fixing it is to go back and ask Congress for more money. More and more money. We have right now have almost twenty trillion dollars in debt. Obamacare will never work. It is very bad, very bad health insurance. Far too expensive, and not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. It's going to be one of the biggest line items, very shortly.We have to repeal it, and replace it with something absolutely much less expensive. And something that works. Where your plan can actually be tailored. We have to get rid of the lines around the state, artificial lines. Where we stop insurance companiesfrom coming in and competing because they wanted President Obama and whoever was working on it. They want to leave those lines because that gives the insurance companies, essentially, monopolies.We want competition. You will have the finest health care plan there is. She wants to go to a single-payer plan, which would be a disaster. Somewhat similar to Canada. And if you haven't noticed the Canadians, when they need a big operation, they come into the United States, in many cases. Because their system is so slow, it is catastrophic in certain ways. But she wants to go to single-payer.Which means the government basically rules everything. Hillary Clinton has been after this for years. Obamacare was the first step. Obamacare is a total disaster. And not only are your rates going up by numbers that no one has ever believed, but your deductibles are going up. So that unless you get hit by a truck, you are never going to be able to use it. It is a disastrous plan and it has to be repealed and replaced.",

I mean look, we are in a situation in our country where if we were to start all over again, we might come up with a different system. But we have an employer-based system. That's where the vast majority of people get their healthcare. And the Affordable Care Act was meant to try to fill the gap between people who were too poor, and couldn't put together any resources to afford health care, namely people on Medicaid, obviously Medicare, which is a single-payer system, which takes care of our elderly and does a great great job doing it, by the way. And then all the people who were employed and people who were working but didn't have the money to afford insurance and didn't have anybody, an employer or anybody else, to help them. That was the slot that the Obamacare approach was to take.And like I say, 20 million people now have health insurance.So if we just rip it up and throw it away, what Donald is not telling you is, we just turn it back to the insurance companies the way it used to be. And that means the insurance companies get to do pretty much whatever they want, including saying, look, I’m sorry you got diabetes, you had cancer, your child has asthma, you may not be able to have insurance because you can’t afford it. So let's fix what is broken about it, but let's not throw it away. And give it all back to the insurance companies.",

Because unfortunately there has been a lot of very divisive, dark things said about Muslims and even someone like Captain Khan, the young man who sacrificed himself defending our country in the United States Army has been subject to attack by Donald.I want to say just a couple of things. First we’ve had Muslims in America since George Washington. And we’ve had many successful Muslims. We just lost a particularly well-known one with Muhammad Ali. My vision of America is an America where everyone has a place if you're willing to work hard, you do your part, you contribute to the community -- that's what America is, that's what we want America to be for children and our grandchildren.It’s also very shortsighted and even dangerous to be engaging in the kind of demagogic rhetoric that Donald has about Muslims. We need American Muslims to be part of our eyes and ears on our front lines. I've worked with a lot of different Muslim groups around America. I've met with a lot of them and I've heard how important it is for them to feel that they are wanted and included and part of our country, part of our homeland security, and that's what I want to see. It's also important - I intend and tend to defeat ISIS to do so in a coalition with majority Muslim nations. Right now a lot of those nations are hearing what Donald says and wondering, “Why should we cooperate with the Americans?” and this is a gift to ISIS and the terrorists. Violent jihadist terrorists. We are not at war with Islam and it is a mistake and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are.

There are children suffering in this catastrophic war, largely I believe, because of Russian aggression. And we need to do our part. We by no means are carrying anywhere near the load that Europe and others are.But we will have vetting that is as tough as it needs to be from our professionals, our intelligence experts, and others. But it is important for us as a policy not to say, as Donald has said, we’re going to ban people based on a religion. How do you do that? We are country founded on religious freedom and liberty. How do we do what he has advocated without causing great distress within our own country? Are we going to have religious tests when people fly into our country? And how do we expect to be able to implement those? So I thought that what he said was extremely unwise and even dangerous and indeed you can look at the propaganda on a lot of the terrorist sites and what Donald Trump says about Muslims is used to recruit fighters because they want to create a war between us. And the final thing I will say this is the tenth or twelfth time that he has denied being for the war in Iraq. We have it on tape. The entire press corps has looked at it.

That was a great -- I thought a great display of presidential leadership.But you know, let's talk about what's really going on here Martha, because our intelligence community just came out and said in the last few days that the Kremlin, meaning Putin and the Russian government, are directing the attacks, the hacking on American accounts, to influence our election. And WikiLeaks is part of that as our other sites, where the Russians hack information, we don't even know it's accurate information, and then they put it out.We have never in the history of our country been in a situation where an adversary, a foreign power, is working so hard to influence the outcome of the election, and believe me, they’re not doing it to get me elected. They're doing it to try to influence the election for Donald Trump.Now maybe because he has praised Putin, maybe because he says he agrees with a lot of what Putin wants to do, maybe because he wants to do business in Moscow -- I don't know the reasons that we deserve answers.

One of the greatest provisions, for people like me, to be honest with you -- I give up a lot when I run because I knock out the tax code. And she could have done this years ago, by the way. She’s a United States -- she was a United States senator. She complains that Donald Trump took advantage of the tax cut. Well, why didn't she change it? Why didn’t you change it when you were Senator? The reason you didn’t that all your friends take the same advantage that I do. But I do.You have provisions in the tax code that, frankly, we could change. But you wouldn't change it because all of these people give you the money so you can take negative ads on Donald Trump. But -- and I say that about a lot of things. You know, I've heard Hillary complain about so many different things over the years -- she’s been doing this stuff -- but she's been there for thirty years she’s been doing this stuff. And she never will change. She never will change. And she never will change.We’re getting rid of carried interest provisions. I'm lowering taxes actually because I think it's so important for corporations because we have corporations leaving -- massive corporations and little ones -- little ones can’t form. We’re getting rid of regulations which goes hand in hand with the lowering of the taxes. But we're bringing the tax rate downfrom thirty five percent to fifteen percent. We’re cutting taxes for the middle class, and I will tell you, we are cutting them big league for the middle class. And I will tell you Hillary Clinton is raising your taxes, folks. You can look at me -- she is raising your taxes really high. And what that's going to do is a disaster for the country. But she is raising your taxes, and I'm lowering your taxes. That in itself is a big difference. We are going to be thriving again. We have no growth in this country. There is no growth. If China has a GDP of seven percent, it’s like a national catastrophe. We’re down at one percent, and that’s like no growth. And we're going lower, in my opinion. And a lot of it has to do with the fact that our taxes are so high. Just about the highest in the world.

His plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had. More than the Bush tax cuts by at least a factor of two. Donald always takes cares of Donald and people like Donald. And this would be a massive gift.And indeed, the way that he talks about his tax cuts would end up raising taxes on middle-class families, millions of middle-class families. Now here's what I want to do. I have said nobody who makes less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars a year -- and that is the vast majority of Americans, as you know, will have their taxes raised because I think we have got to go with the money is. And the money is with people who have taken advantage of every single break in the tax code. And yes, when I was a senator, I did vote to close corporate loopholes.I voted to close, I think, one of the loopholes he took advantage of what he claimed a billion dollar loss that enabled him to avoid paying taxes. I want to have a tax on people who are making a million dollars. It’s called the Buffett rule -- yes, Warren Buffett is the one who has gone out and said somebody like him did not repent a lower tax rate than his secretary. I want to have a surcharge on incomes above five million. We have to make up for lost time because I want to invest in you. I want to invest in hard-working families, and I think it's been unfortunate. But it’s happened that since the great recession, the gains have all gone to the top. And we need to reverse that. People like Donald who paid zero in taxes, zero for our vets, zero for our military, zero for health and education -- that is wrong.

So let me talk about my thirty years in public service. I'm very glad to do so.Eight million kids every year have health insurance because when I was first lady, I worked with Democrats and Republicans to create the children's health insurance program. Hundreds of thousands of kids now have a chance to be adopted because I worked to change our adoption and foster care system. After 9/11, I went to work with a Republican mayor, governor and president to rebuild New York and to get healthcare for our first responders who were suffering because they had a run toward danger and gotten sickened by it. Hundreds of thousands of National Guard and reserve members have healthcare because of work that I did. And children have safer medicines because I was able to pass a law that required the dosing to be more carefully done.When I was secretary of state, I went around the world, advocating for our country but also advocating for women's rights, to make sure that women had a decent chance to have a better life, and negotiated a treaty with Russia to lower nuclear weapons.Four hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it, as a sponsor or cosponsor when I was a senator for eight years. I worked very hard and was very proud to be reelected in New York by an even bigger margin than I had been elected the first time. And as president, I will take that work, that bipartisan work, that finding common ground, because you have to be able to get along with people to get things done in Washington.",

Just days ago, the State Department called for a war crimes investigation of the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad and its allies Russia for the bombardment of Aleppo. So this next question comes from social media through Facebook. Diane from Pennsylvania asked, if you were president, what would you do about Syria and the humanitarian crisis in Aleppo?

And every day that goes by, we see the results of the regime by Assad in partnership with the Iranians on the ground, the Russians in the air, bombarding places, in particular Aleppo, where there are hundreds of thousands of people, probably about 250,000 still left. And there is a determined effort by the Russian Air Force to destroy Aleppo in order to eliminate the last of the Syrian rebels who are really holding out against the Assad regime. Russia hasn't paid any attention to ISIS. They’re interested in keeping Assad in power. So I, when I was Secretary of State, advocated. And I advocate today a no-fly zone in safe zones.We need some leverage with the Russians because they're not going to come to the negotiating table for a diplomatic resolution unless there is some leverage over them. And we have to work more closely with our partners and allies on the ground. But I want to emphasize that what is at stake here is the ambitions and the aggressiveness of Russia.Russia has decided that it's all in in Syria. And they also decided who they want to see become president of the United States, too. And it's not me. I've stood up to Russia. I've taken on pollutant and others. And I would do that as president. I think wherever we can cooperate with Russia, that's fine. And I did at Secretary of State, that’s how we got a treaty reducing nuclear weapons. It’s how we got the sanctions on Iran that put a lid on the Iranian nuclear program without firing a single shot. So I would go to the negotiating table with more leverage that we have now. But I do support the effort to investigate for crimes -- war crimes committed by the Syrians and the Russians and try to hold them accountable.",

She doesn’t even know who the rebels are. Every time we take rebels. Whether it's in Iraq or anywhere else. We are arming people. And you know what happens? They end up being worse than the people. Look what she did and Libya with Gaddafi. Gadhafi is out. It’s a mess. And by the way ISIS has a good chunk of their oil.I’m sure you probably have heard that. It was a disaster. Because the fact is that everything that she has done an foreign-policy has been at the stake and it has a been a disaster. And if you look at Russia -- is take a look at Russia and look at what they did this week. Where I agree she was not there, but possibly she was consulted. We sign a peace treaty, everyone's all excited. Well what Russia did with Assad, and by the way with Iran who made very powerful with the dumbest deal I have ever seen in the history of dealmaking with the Iran deal. With the 1.7 in cash, which is enough cash to fill this room. But look at that deal. Iran now and Russia are now against us. So she wants to fight, she wants to fight for rebels.

And she has been talking about the inner cities for twenty five years. Nothing is going to ever happen.Let me tell you, if she is president of the United States nothing is going to happen. It is going to be all talk, all of her friends, taxes we were talking, and I would just get it by osmosis, it’s not doing me any favors, but by doing all the others favor she would be doing me favors. But I will tell you, she is all talk, it doesn't get done. All you have to do is look at the Senate run, take a look at upstate New York.",

Mr. Carter, I have tried my entire life, to do what I can to support children and families. You know, right out of law school I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund. And Donald talks a lot about, you know, the thirty years I've been in public service. I am proud of that. You know, I started off as a young lawyer working against discrimination against African-American children in schools and in the criminal justice system. I worked to make sure that kids with disabilities could get a public education. Something that I care very much about. I have worked with Latinos, one of my first jobs in politics was down in South Texas registering Latino citizens to be able to vote.So I have a deep devotion to use your absolutely correct word. To making sure that every American feels like he or she has a place in our country. And, I think when you look at the letters that I get, a lot of people are worried that maybe they wouldn't have a place in Donald Trump's America. They write me -- one woman wrote me about her son Felix, he adopted himfrom Ethiopia when he was a toddler. He is ten years old now. This is the only country he has ever known. And he listens to Donald on TV and he said to his mother one day, will he send me back to Ethiopia if he gets elected? You know, children listen to what is being said, to go back to the very, very first question. And there is a lot of fear; in fact, teachers and parents are calling it the Trump effect. Bullying is up, a lot of people are feeling, you know, uneasy, a lot of kids are expressing their concerns.So first and foremost, I will do everything I can to reach out to everybody. Democrats, Republicans, Independents, people across our country. If you don't vote for me, I still want to be your president. I want to be the best president I can be for every American.",

I want to appoint Supreme Court justices who understand the way the world really works, who have real-life experience, who have not just been in a big law firm and maybe clerked for a judge then gotten on the bench, but you know, maybe they tried some more cases, they actually understand what people are up against.Because I think the current court has gone in the wrong direction. And so I would want to see the Supreme Court reverse Citizens United. And get dark, unaccountable money out of our politics. Donald doesn’t agree with that. I would like the Supreme Court to understand that voting rights are still a big problem in many parts of our country. That we don’t always do everything we can to make it possible for people of color and older people and young people to be able to exercise their franchise. I want a Supreme Court that will stick with Roe v. Wade and a woman’s right to choose, and I want a Supreme Court that will stick with marriage equality.Now Donald has put forth the names of some people that he would consider, and among the ones that he has suggested are people who would reverse Roe v. Wade and reverse marriage equality. I think that would be a terrible mistake and would take us backwards. I want a Supreme Court that doesn’t always side with corporate interests. I want a Supreme Court that understands because you’re wealthy and can give more money to something, doesn’t mean you have any more rights or should have more rights than anyone else. So I have very clear views about what I want to see to kind of change the balance on the Supreme Court.And I regret deeply that the Senate hasn’t done its job. And they have not permitted a vote on the person that President Obama- a highly qualified person - they’ve not given him a vote to be able to have the full complement of nine Supreme Court justices.I think that was a dereliction of duty. I hope that they will see their way to doing it, but if I am so fortunate enough as to be president I will immediately move to make sure that we fill that -",

Also the Second Amendment which is totally under siege by people like Hillary Clinton. They’ll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for and what it represents. So important to me.

I’m putting in more - by the time it is finished, I’ll have more than 100 million dollars invested. Pretty much self-funding mine, we’re raising money for the Republican party and we’re doing tremendously under small donations, $61 average or so.I ask Hillary - why doesn’t she make $250 million by being in office? She used the power of her office to make a lot of money. Why isn’t she funding -- not for $100 million, but why don’t you put $10 or $20 or $25 or $30 million into your own campaign? It’s $30 million less for special interests that will tell you exactly what to do, and it would really, I think, be a nice sign to the American public. Why aren’t you putting some money in?

        "text": "Absolutely. I think it’s such a great question, because energy is under siege by the Obama administration. Under absolute siege. The EPA - the Environmental Protection Agency -  is killing these energy companies. And foreign companies are now coming in, buying so many of our different plants and then rejiggering the plant so they can take care of their oil. We are killing, absolutely killing our energy business in this country. Now I’m all for alternative forms of energy, including wind, including solar, etc. But we need much more than wind and solar. And you look at our miners. Hillary Clinton wants to put all the miners out of business. There is a thing called clean coal. Coal will last for a thousand years in this country. Now we have natural gas and so many other things because of technology. We have unbelievable - we have found over the last seven years, we have found tremendous wealth right under our feet, so good. Especially when you have 20 trillion in debt. I will bring our energy companies back. They’ll be able to compete. They’ll make money. They’ll pay off our national debt. They’ll pay off our tremendous budget deficits -- which are tremendous. But we are putting our energy companies out of business. We have to bring back our workers. You take a look at what’s happening to steel, and the cost of steel. And China dumping vast amounts of steel over the United States, which essentially is killing our steel workers and our steel companies. We have to guard our energy companies. We have to make it possible - the EPA is so restrictive that they are putting our energy companies out of business. And all you have to do is go to a great place like West Virginia or places like Ohio, which is phenomenal, or places like Pennsylvania, and you see what they’re doing to the people, miners and others in the energy business, it’s a disgrace. It’s an absolute disgrace.",

        "text": "Well, that was very interesting. First of all, China is illegally dumping steel in the United States, and Donald Trump is buying it to build his buildings. Putting steel workers and American steel plants out of business. That’s something that I fought against as a senator and I would have a trade prosecutor to make sure we don’t get taken advantage of by China on steel or anything else.You know because it sounds like you’re in the business or you’re aware of people in the business. You know that we are now, for the first time ever, energy independent. We are not dependent upon the Middle East. But the Middle East still controls a lot of the prices. So the price of oil has been way down and that has had a damaging effect on a lot of the oil companies, right? We are, however, producing a lot of natural gas which serves as a bridge to more renewable fuels. And I think that’s an important transition.We’ve got to remain energy independent. It gives us much more power and freedom than to be worried about what goes on in the Middle East. We have enough worries over there without having to worrying about that.So I have a comprehensive energy policy but it really does include fighting climate change because I think that is a serious problem. And I support moving to more clean and renewable energy as quickly as we can. Because I think we can be the 21st century clean energy superpower and create millions of new jobs and businesses. But I also want to be sure we don’t leave people behind. That’s why I’m the only candidate,from the very beginning of this campaign, who had a plan to help us revitalize coal country. Because those coal miners and their fathers and their grandfathers, they dug that coal out, a lot of them lost their lives, they were injured, but they turned the lights on and powered our factories. I don’t want to walk awayfrom them. So we’ve got to do something for them.But the price of coal is down worldwide. So we have to look at this comprehensively and that’s exactly what I have proposed. I hope you will go to HillaryClinton.com.",

        "text": "Well, I certainly will because I think that is a very fair and important question. Look, I respect his children. His children are incredibly able and devoted, and I think that says a lot about Donald. I don’t agree with nearly anything else he says or does. But I do respect that and I think that is something that as a mother and a grandmother is very important to me. So, I believe that this election has become in part so conflict-oriented, so intense. Because there’s a lot at stake. This is not an ordinary time, and this is not an ordinary election. We are going to be choosing a president who will set policy not just for four or eight years, but because of some of the important decisions we have to make here at home and in the world,from the Supreme Court to energy, and so much else, and so there is a lot at stake. It’s one of the most consequential elections that we’ve had. And that’s why I’ve tried to put forth specific policies and plans, trying to get it off the personal and get it on to what I want to do as president. And that’s why I hope people will check on that for themselves, so they can see that yes, I’ve spent thirty years, actually maybe a little more, working to help kids and families, and I want to take that experience to the White House and do that every single day.",

She doesn't give up. I respect that. I tell it like it is. She's a fighter. I disagree with much of what she's fighting for. I do disagree with her judgment in many cases. But she does fight hard, and she doesn’t quit. And she doesn't give up, and I consider that to be a very good trait.",
